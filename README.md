# Problem
- Portugal Bank needs a model to able to predict potential clients well enough. Furthermore, we want to create a model that has low probability of predicting 'No' to an actual clients wanting to subscribe to our service. (Problem 1)
- How to make future campaigns more effective and impactful (Problem 2)

# Aim
In this project we will create a classification model for Portugal Bank in order to classify a client of joining or not joining our term-deposit service. The evaluation metrics that are focused more on are Accuracy & Recall.

# Notebook
- PART A    : EDA & its Analysis

- Part B    : Machine Learning
    - Feature Engineering
    - Data Preprocessing
    - Modeling
    - Evaluation

- Part C    : Conclusion & Recommendation
    - Model Conclusion (Problem 1)
    - Recommendation for Future Campaigns (Problem 2)

# NOTE: 
In this notebook, only the best processes that are included. However, we have tried different processes in feature engineering, preprocessing, and resampling method to get the best model.
